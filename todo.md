Develop and implement an image classification model to crop down the section of a utlilty pole that contains the tag number. Use OCR to read the tag number.
- [ ] Research and select an appropriate image classification model for utility pole tag number detection.
- [ ] Collect a dataset of utility pole images with visible tag numbers.
- [ ] Preprocess the images to ensure consistent input size and format for the model.
- [ ] Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- [ ] Train the image classification model on the training set.
- [ ] Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set and adjust hyperparameters as needed.
